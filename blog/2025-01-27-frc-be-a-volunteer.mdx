Be a volunteer at FIRSTRobotics Competition's Southern Cross Regional like me in March 2025, together we will bring this epic event to life! 🤖 If you think robots and AI might take over the world, this might just be ground zero! ⚡

No experience? No problem! There's a role for everyone, and trust me - you'll find something you love. Lucky me, I got assigned to Field Reset role for my first time at the event ! 🚀 Can't wait to be in the middle of the action, helping teams compete at their best.
