Our 1st in-person & online GitHub hashtag#Copilot workshop of 2025 was a big success! 🎉 Over 100 participants from Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane joined us to learn, explore, and share how hashtag#GitHubCopilot can elevate our development experience.

💡 The story I shared during the Copilot presentation, reflecting on my 20 years as a coder. If I have 500 lines of legacy code to rewrite for a migration project:

🔹 20 years ago (when I was young and naive 😎), I would've started typing away ⌨️ - taking days to complete.
🔹10 years ago (when I was young but no longer naive 🤔), I would've googled tools 🔍 to do migration. 
🔹Now (when I’m neither young nor naive! 😅), I definitely ask GitHub Copilot to have a go first. ⏳ 15 seconds later, it generated working migrated code in another language & just one minor bug found in testing! ✅

After a full day of workshops, labs, presentations, and hackathons, we wrapped up with drinks 🍹 and great conversations. To top it off, I even scored a free mini gin bottle - winner! (I will drink responsibly). Fantastic having you around, I-van, Ahmed, Rakesh & Peachy! Sorry Ross, you have missed it.

🙌 Huge thanks to everyone who joined and made it an awesome day. Cheers to more opportunities to learn and use hashtag#AI to make our hashtag#developer lives more fun and hashtag#productive!
