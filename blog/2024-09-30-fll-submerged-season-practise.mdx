Our Year 7 & 8 team is diving deep into the past with our project for the **FIRST LEGO League Submerged season**! We're developing **BlueBerry**, a deep-sea rover designed to explore the ocean floor ðŸŒŠ and uncover ancient civilizations lost to time. Rover BlueBerry will help identify and analyze submerged ruins and artifacts, bringing marine archaeology into the future.

## What Makes "BlueBerry" Special?
- **Eco-Friendly Design**: We're committed to minimizing our rover's environmental impact on delicate marine ecosystems.
- **Real-World Potential**: We aim for BlueBerry to be a tool for professional marine archaeologists, aiding in real discoveries.
- **AI-Powered Discovery**: BlueBerry uses AI to recognize archaeological finds and send real-time data to researchers on the surface.

## Preparing for Competition & Seeking Expert Advice
As we gear up for the **regional competition**, we're fine-tuning BlueBerry's design and capabilities. We'd love insights from LinkedIn expertsâ€”whether in robotics, AI, or marine archaeology. 

- **What challenges** should we expect with underwater exploration?
- **How can we enhance BlueBerry's AI** for more accurate artifact detection?

## 3D Model and Landscape

We've designed a 3D model and are ready to print it!
