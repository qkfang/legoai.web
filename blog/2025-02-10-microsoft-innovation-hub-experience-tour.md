Being part of the Microsoft Innovation Hub tour in North Sydney with MVPs & RDs tonight was an incredible and inspiring experience! 💡 This hub is a dynamic space showcasing game-changing AI and technology in action. 

The presentation on agentic AI were truly fascinating. 🤖 My inner tech geek especially liked the deep dives into hashtag#SemanticKernel, hashtag#AutoGen, hashtag#Magentic-One, and hashtag#AzureAIFoundry. The demo on medical research using hashtag#GraphRAG 🔍 is a brilliant example of AI driving real-world impact!

The hashtag#InnovationHub tour was also eye-opening, featuring innovations across industries:
🏥 Smart hospital bed that monitors patient vitals, enhanced with HoloLens-powered medical visualizations for teaching
🛍️ AI-driven retail solutions tracking stock levels and providing staff with instant insights
📚 Personalized learning AI app designed to help students focus and tailor their education
👀 Accessibility tool using eye-tracking to control computer actions

The future of hashtag#AI is exciting, transformative, and full of endless possibilities! 🚀 Can’t wait to see how these innovations shape the world! ✨

Thanks so much for the session, the 'jazz band'! Loved your 2 SQL jokes, Viren.

Great catch up with Elizabeth, Sam, Arafat, Nick, Jayanth, Jourdan, Roland, Zeeshan and everyone in the room!
