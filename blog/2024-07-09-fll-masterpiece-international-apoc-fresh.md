Team Cleverbots embarked on an exciting journey this year, advancing through both regional and national competitions. Their dedication and hard work paid off when they were invited to participate in the prestigious international competition for the `Masterpiece` season. As part of their innovation project, I had the privilege of helping them develop a web app. The app, powered by an AI chatbot, is designed to inspire people to explore new hobbies through personalized recommendations, making it easier for users to discover activities they might not have otherwise considered.

As the coach of Team Cleverbots, I work closely with a group of seven enthusiastic Year 7 and 8 girls. Their drive and passion for technology are remarkable, and together they developed an innovative application called "Fresh - Hobby Sharing AI App." During the four-day international event, I supported the team by delivering presentations, demonstrating the app’s unique features, and helping them engage with participants from across the globe. The event was a melting pot of creativity, featuring robot competitions and team-building exercises, with 52 teams representing 26 different countries. It was a fantastic opportunity for the girls to showcase their skills and creativity on a global stage.

This international event not only served as a platform to demonstrate the power of AI in innovation but also sparked meaningful conversations among coaches, educators, and participants. We discussed the implications of AI in education, how it can shape the future, and the importance of ensuring that young students are empowered to create with these technologies. The event highlighted how technology can be a tool for both personal growth and global collaboration, and I’m incredibly proud to have been part of such an inspiring experience with Team Cleverbots.
