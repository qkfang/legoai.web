🌧️💨❄️ It was rainy, windy, and cold … but the passion for learning GitHub hashtag#Copilot @ Microsoft Wellington office could not be stopped ! 💙🚀 (the pigeons were shivering🐦🥶 that day - last photo)

Rakesh, Kotomi and I went all in with a full-on 7-hour GitHub Copilot workshop, covering presentations, live demos, video tutorials, keynotes, and hands-on 3x persona-based labs. From front-end and back-end development to full-stack, data science, data engineering, DevOps, and more, we explored how hashtag#GitHubCopilot is revolutionizing the way we code.

🔥 The highlight of the day? The power of hashtag#CopilotEdits' Agent mode - taking AI-assisted development to a whole new level! It's not just about suggestions; it's about transforming how we build, optimize, and hashtag#innovate.

Huge thanks to everyone who joined and made this an incredible learning experience! Who else is excited about the future of AI-powered development? Let's keep the momentum going! 💡💻
