There's a unique kind of joy in watching your child's eyes light up with curiosity and wonder. This past weekend, I experienced that magic firsthand when our eagerly awaited LEGO WeDo kit arrived. My six-year-old son and I embarked on an engineering adventure right in our living room, building creations and exploring the basics of coding. 

The excitement was palpable as we unboxed the LEGO WeDo kit. My 5 year-old son could hardly contain himself, his tiny fingers itching to dive into the piles of colorful bricks, sensors, and motors. For those unfamiliar, LEGO WeDo is an introductory robotics kit that combines the joy of building with the basics of programming, designed especially for young minds.

## Building Our First Robot Together

We spread out all the pieces on the floor, the instruction manual open on the tablet. Deciding on the first project was a challenge in itself: should we build the roaring lion, the drumming monkey, or perhaps the sweeping robot? We settled on the alligator, a model that promised movement and sound.

As we assembled the pieces, I was amazed at how intuitive the process was for my son. He followed the visual instructions, found the right bricks, and started snapping them together with minimal guidance. It was a proud moment seeing his determination and problem-solving skills in action.

## Diving into Coding

Once our alligator took shape, it was time to bring it to life with code. We connected the model to our computer, and the real fun began. The WeDo software uses a simple drag-and-drop interface, perfect for young children to grasp the fundamentals of programming.

*"Let's make the alligator's mouth open and close,"* I suggested.

*"Can it roar, too?"* my son asked eagerly.

Together, we selected blocks of code that controlled the motor and added sound effects. With a click, our creation sprang to life: the alligator's mouth snapped open and shut while emitting a playful roar. The look on my son's face was priceless.

## Learning Through Play

What struck me most about this experience was how seamlessly learning blended with play. Without realizing it, my son was picking up concepts like sequences, loops, and cause-and-effect. He experimented with different coding blocks, curious about what each one would do.

*"What happens if we change this number?"* he wondered aloud, pointing to the duration of the motor's movement.

*"Let's try it and see,"* I encouraged.

We spent hours tinkering, adjusting, and testing, each modification bringing a new lesson and a new burst of excitement.

## A Day Well Spent

As the day wound down, we sat back and admired our work. We had not only built a functioning robot but also shared laughs, solved problems, and learned new skills together. It was more than just assembling bricks and writing code; it was about connecting with my son in a meaningful way.

Our engineering day with the LEGO WeDo kit was a resounding success. It opened up a world of creativity and learning that we can't wait to explore further. If you're a parent looking for a way to engage your child in STEM activities, I highly recommend giving LEGO WeDo a try. It's a fantastic way to have fun while laying the groundwork for critical thinking and technological literacy.
