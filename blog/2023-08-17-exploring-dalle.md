We are interested in exploring how AI can help with our research, brainstorming, and feedback. We tried using **ChatGPT** and **DALLÂ·E** to generate answers to our questions and to understand the best ways to use these new tools. We also had a lot of fun creating AI-generated images to help us visualize our innovation project.

Using `ChatGPT`, we were able to brainstorm ideas more efficiently. Whenever we hit a roadblock, we asked ChatGPT for suggestions, and it provided us with fresh perspectives we hadn't considered before. It was like having a collaborative partner available 24/7, ready to help us think through complex problems.

`DALL-E`, on the other hand, allowed us to bring our ideas to life visually. By inputting descriptions of concepts and scenarios related to our project, `DALL-E` generated images that captured the essence of our thoughts. This was incredibly helpful during team meetings, as visual aids made it easier for everyone to understand and contribute to the discussion.
