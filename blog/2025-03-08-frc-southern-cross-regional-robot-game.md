FIRST Robotics Competition Southern Cross Regional today - my very first time volunteering at hashtag#FRC! It's the second day of the hashtag#REEFSCAPE season at Penrith Valley Regional Sports Centre, and I'm already in awe of the ⚡ energy, 🔧 innovation, and 🤝 teamwork on display.

hashtag#FRC is the ultimate sport for the mind ✨, where 40+ high school student teams take on real-world engineering challenges, designing and building industrial-sized robots from a kit of parts to compete in an intense, fast-paced game. But beyond the robots, it's about creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork, all guided by the spirit of hashtag#GraciousProfessionalism.

This year's challenge, hashtag#REEFSCAPE 🌊, is all about using engineering to strengthen one of the ocean's most diverse habitats. It's inspiring to see young minds tackling big problems and shaping the future of hashtag#STEM.

It was a great pleasure to reconnect with old friends (Garry & Jack), see familiar faces, and make new connections! Exciting to witness teams like 'AI3' showcasing their AI-powered robot, an incredible display of innovation! 🤩🤖

A huge congratulations to Melinda for the 'Woodie Flowers Finalist Award' and to Mark for being 'Volunteer of the Year'! The awards are the perfect recognition of your dedication and countless contributions over so many years. 👏🎉

It's been a long day from 7 AM to 6:30 PM ⏳, but I've gained a whole new appreciation for the impact of FIRST empowering students and fostering a strong STEM community. Excited for the final day of the competition tomorrow! 🚀
