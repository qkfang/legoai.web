We're thrilled to share that Team Cleverbots truly shined at the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) Regional competition for the *Submerged* season, held at Macquarie University! Competing among 30 incredibly talented teams, our young innovators secured two major awards: the **Robot Performance Award** for the top score and the **Robot Design Award**. Yes, we're headed to nationals again! 🎉🏆🏆

### LEGO, AI, and the Future of Learning

One of the highlights of our journey this season was how the team approached and embraced artificial intelligence (AI). In our judging session, the Cleverbots were asked, "How do you use AI in your project and coding?" The response from our team members was insightful beyond their years: 

> "We don't copy from it. We use AI to explain coding questions. We understand its limitations like bias. We've learned prompt engineering."

These answers reflected not just technical skills but critical thinking and a mature understanding of AI's capabilities and constraints. They're not only mastering robotics but also developing a responsible and thoughtful approach to technology—skills that will serve them well in the future. 🌟

### The Electric Energy of FLL Competitions

Walking into an FLL event is like stepping into a whirlwind of creativity and excitement. The energy is contagious, with kids buzzing with ideas and eager to share their robotic creations. It's a sight to see young minds working tirelessly to solve complex challenges, and every volunteer, judge, and referee plays a pivotal role in making these events memorable. Special thanks to Melinda and Fredrik—your dedication means the world to these budding engineers!

### A Tribute to Jack: A Mentor for Generations

No FLL event would be complete without a nod to Jack, a true hero and inspiration for so many young participants. For 15 years, Jack has been guiding and inspiring teams with the same enthusiasm and kindness. Our coach Bianca, a former FLL student herself, captured the sentiment perfectly: "Jack hasn't changed!" Thank you, Jack, for your invaluable contributions to this community and for being a role model to so many kids.

To all the teams, volunteers, and mentors: thank you for making this journey unforgettable. Here's to the amazing power of teamwork, innovation, and the enduring magic of LEGO and learning! 🚀
