With just two weeks to go until the FLL Submerged Nationals, excitement is building as 48 of the top teams from across NSW and ACT prepare to gather. The atmosphere is electric as we look forward to meeting all the incredible teams, exchanging ideas, and marveling at the creativity displayed in their innovation projects.

### Sharpening Our Innovation Project

Our team has been hard at work improving every aspect of our innovation project. The spotlight is currently on our rover design, which we're reworking in **Fusion 360** (no more TinkerCad). This powerful engineering software has allowed us to refine our 3D model with precision, resulting in a sleek and functional design that's as impressive as it is innovative. Watching the project come to life through our 3D printer has been a thrill.

Previously, printing the model required multiple smaller components, but now we've optimized the process to print the entire rover in one go! This is no small featâ€”it's been tricky to ensure every component is accurate, steady, and durable. Despite the challenges, we're getting closer to perfection with every iteration.

### Raising the Bar in the Robot Game

On the robot game front, the stakes have never been higher. After scoring a solid **345 points** at regionals, we were feeling confidentâ€”until another team surpassed our score. This healthy competition has lit a fire under us, pushing everyone to bring their A-game.

Our team's mantra? **Keep improving.** Today's practice session was a testament to that commitment: we racked up an impressive **465 points!** Through tireless tweaking of robot designs, refining our attachments, and honing strategies, we're discovering new ways to push boundaries and maximize efficiency.

Preparation for Nationals has truly been a team effort. Whether it's reworking the rover design, troubleshooting the 3D printer, or diving into the robot game's mechanics, every member has been playing a crucial role. Even I've had to hit the books, ensuring I can answer any questions and offer the support our team needs.

With just two weeks left, our focus remains sharp. There's no doubt the competition will be fierce, but we're ready to rise to the challenge. Nationals isn't just about the scores; it's about the journey, the learning, and the camaraderie that comes from working together toward a shared goal. 

Checkout the badges we have made. The AI badges are created by Bing Copilot & Dall-e, looks pretty awesome! Bet it is going to be a hit during the nationals.
