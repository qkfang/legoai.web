I'm excited to share that today I had the incredible opportunity to attend the **Global Azure Sydney 2024** user group session at the Microsoft Reactor today! Even more thrilling, I got to present my experiences with AI and coding during the event. It was an amazing moment to share my journey, including how I've been exploring AI model fine-tuning and integrating it with robotics like Spike Prime. Feeling grateful for the chance to connect with so many passionate people in the field and exchange ideas!

Here's a quick overview of my talk and some key takeaways:

- **The Power of AI in Code Generation**: I dive into how I've been using Azure's fine-tuning to create more efficient, domain-specific code for robotics.
- **From Generic Python to Robot-Specific Commands**: I shared my experience building models that turn general Python code into Spike Prime-specific instructions.
- **Azure Endpoint Integration**: I walked through how to set up and connect an AI model to a local environment, demonstrating real-time interactions with the Spike Prime robot.
