âœ¨ Spent the morning at Microsoft Fabric Innovation Summit in Microsoftâ€™s North Sydney office, and the room was fully packed! From Fabric's real-time intelligence âš¡to agent & copilot-infused experiences ðŸ¤–, every demo showcased how hashtag#Fabric is re-imagining data & AI for the enterprise. 

Insightful presentations and demos from Vyas and Francesco-Giorgio, especially the demos of integrating AI into batch processing and data streaming. It was great to see how easy it is to leverage hashtag#Copilot and hashtag#DataAgent with just a few clicks! âœ¨

We were fortunate to have Bogdan, Yitzhak and Harsha in the room, sharing their vision for Fabric's future ðŸ”®, unveiling upcoming features & product roadmap, and open QnA. Great questions from everyone, especially Ali's, bringing our customers' day-to-day needs right into the discussion. ðŸ§©

The event reminded me of my data analysis, reporting, and performance-tuning days from ten years ago. Fun fact ðŸ˜„: I'm an old-school Microsoft Certified Master for hashtag#SQLServer, one of those folks who survived the eight-hour live lab test on SQL performance tuning! ðŸ’ª

Kudos to the Microsoft team (Clare, Jeanne, Elizabeth and more) for bringing the energy and insights of hashtag#FabCon from Las Vegas to Australia! 

Everyone left inspired ðŸš€, with a Jupyter notebook full of ideas to accelerate our own data & AI roadmap. ðŸ““
