AI App in a Day @ Microsoft Sydney Office ! 🤖 Fantastic day at Room Gaba and Magari on Level 27, exploring AI on Microsoft Azure with an incredible group of engaged participants alongside my Insight colleague, Sadat on Monday!

We dove deep into hashtag#PromptEngineering, hashtag#RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and exploring powerful services on Azure to build hashtag#AIApp like:
 ✅ Azure hashtag#OpenAI Service
 ✅ hashtag#CosmosDB for MongoDB
 ✅ GPT and Embedding Models
 ✅ hashtag#LangChain
 ✅ hashtag#AzureAIFoundry
 ✅ Azure hashtag#AISearch
 ✅ Azure hashtag#ContentSafety
 ✅ hashtag#DocumentIntelligence Service

✨The discussions were insightful, the hands-on experience was valuable, and the views from Level 27? Simply stunning! 🌆

💡A big thank you to everyone who joined and contributed to the learning experience. AI is evolving fast, and it’s exciting to see the energy around building real-world AI solutions! 🚀

👏 Huge thanks for your support and organizing the event, Jeanne, Peachy, Michelle & Ross!
