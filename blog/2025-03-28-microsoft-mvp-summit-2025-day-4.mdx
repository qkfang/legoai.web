Last Day @ Microsoft MVP Summit 2025 ! What an incredible week it's been! MVPSummit was packed with deep dives, insightful discussions, and direct interactions with the amazing product teams. 

Microsoft Redmond campus felt like a dream, just like a kid stepping into Disneyland for the very first time. Every hallway, every session, every conversation sparked curiosity and connection. Grateful for the opportunity to be part of such a passionate and brilliant community.

I'm heading back to home sweet home - Sydney with a suitcase full of swags, stickers, knowledge, and inspiration!
