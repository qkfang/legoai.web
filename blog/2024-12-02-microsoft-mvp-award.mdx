ðŸŽ‰ I've been accepted into the Microsoft MVP Program (Azure AI Services)! Yes, I'm as surprised as you are! ðŸ˜Š

Here's what happened: when I joined Insight, Saadullah said to me, "You've got to keep an eye on Simon, he's doing amazing work in the community." So, I did! Like many MVPs, he's basically a walking RSS feed for user groups, conferences, and tech meetups. One day, on a whim, I submitted a talk and told him, "Hey, I did it, now that?" ðŸ™ƒ He replied: "well, the chance to get in is pretty slim but don't give up, keep trying." 

That small nudge set everything in motion.ðŸ’¥ After a few goes, I got my first public tech talk, things just started flowing â€“ more events, more opportunities, and deeper involvement with tech and school community. The past six months have been incredibly intense. Just last week, I attended five events in ten days - early bird and red-eye flights to get there (a personal record for me ðŸ˜…!). It's been a whirlwind of incredible experiences and unforgettable moments.

To anyone thinking about starting your community journey â€“ take that first step. You never know where it might lead.
