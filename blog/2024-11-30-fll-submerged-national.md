"A team of all girls always endeavor, to charm and inspire, and to be also clever! Congratulation goes to the CLEVERBOTS!!" 👏 - the judges said about the team in the award ceremony. The innovative project & core value presentation with customized t-shirt, headband, name tags, text badges, and AI badges, clearly made an impression, earning high praise from the judges. 🙌

After three months of relentless hard work, the team scored outstanding 395 points in their first Robot Game run 🤖. Cleverbots not only had an incredible day but also secured the 3rd highest score on the East Coast 🥳 (Nationals North, East, South) - Perth's event is next week.

As their volunteer coach for the past two years, I couldn't be prouder of these amazing future engineers and innovators. Watching them grow, collaborate, and achieve greatness has been nothing short of inspiring. 💖
