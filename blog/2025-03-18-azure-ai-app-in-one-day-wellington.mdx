🚀 AI App in a Day is back in Wellington! 🌿 During today's session, Rakesh and I explored AzureAI services, ContentSafety, AISearch, CosmosDB, LangChain, and various techniques to enhance LLM responses, ensuring more accurate, efficient, and context-aware AI solutions. 🚀🔍

This time, we added a Jupyter Notebook for Graph RAG (from Microsoft Research) as new lab exercise, and it was amazing to see one of the participants had already implemented GraphRAG in a past project! 🔥 Seeing real-world applications of AI in action is always inspiring.

Of course, no event is complete without tasty food and awesome swag! 🍕👕 Speaking of swag… quick question: does anyone know what number 42 stands for in the "Build on Azure - Code is Life" T-shirt? 🤔 (3rd photo) We could not figure it out !

A huge thank you to everyone who joined us, it was an incredible day, especially with that stunning afternoon weather! ☀️ 

Keep building, keep innovating on Azure ! 💡✨
