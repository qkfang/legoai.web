We've officially started exploring robot tutorials with the **LEGO Spike Prime** kit, and it's been quite the learning adventure! While Spike Prime is designed to be educational and user-friendly, getting started with coding was a bit trickier than I anticipated, especially for my young daughter.

As someone who's fairly comfortable with technology, I was surprised to find myself facing some hurdles, particularly when figuring out how to get the motor up and running. The block-based coding interface appears simple at first glance, but once we delved deeper, we realized there are quite a few features that aren't immediately visible. It turns out you have to enable extension blocks to unlock all the coding options, which definitely took us a moment to discover.

For my daughter, the experience was a bit overwhelming at first. Coding, even in a visual format like this, can be intimidating for a beginner, especially when you're still learning how different blocks function and interact with the hardware. But we're taking it slow, working through tutorials together, and focusing on breaking down each task step by step. Once we activated the extension blocks, it opened up a whole new set of possibilities. Suddenly, we had more control over the motors, sensors, and all the cool features we hadn't noticed before.

The good news is that `Spike Prime 3` offers a lot of flexibility for different skill levels. As we continue exploring, I can already see my daughter gaining confidence. She's becoming more curious and asking questions like, "What happens if we change this block?" or "How do we make the robot move faster?" That's the beauty of this kit, it sparks curiosity and creativity, even if there are a few challenges along the way.

We're still in the early stages, but I'm excited to continue our coding journey. With every tutorial we tackle, we're learning something new, and it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to grow together. Stay tuned for more updates as we get the hang of coding and start building some really fun projects!
