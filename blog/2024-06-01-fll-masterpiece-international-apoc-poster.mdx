Hooray! 🎉 Our girls' FIRST LEGO League team is heading to the Asia Pacific Open Championships (APOC https://www.firstaustralia.org/asia-pacific-open-championships) this July! 

It's been an incredible journey through last year's regional and national competitions. As their coding mentor (still learning my ways), I rebuilt the FLL competition table at home for their extra Robot Game practice over the weekends. 

🌏Now, it's the time for international!
