Had the pleasure of meeting Microsoft MVP Xiaodi Yan here in Wellington â€” what an inspiring and insightful catch-up!

Huge thanks for the delicious food and even bigger congratulations on your recently published book, Web API Development with ASP.NET Core 8! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ“š

Incredible to hear it's now part of the Microsoft Redmond campus library â€” a truly well-deserved recognition!

Always energizing to connect with folks who are passionate about tech and generous in sharing their knowledge. Looking forward to more conversations ahead!
