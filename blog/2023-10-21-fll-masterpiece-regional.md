Here we go! It's finally time for the` Masterpiece Season`'s regional competition in `Abbotsleigh`! The school is sending three teams, and we're proud to be one of them. The anticipation has been building, and the day has finally arrived.

The journey to the venue was smooth, with an easy ride on the train. When we arrived, we were greeted by over 15 teams, all ready to compete. The energy in the room was incredible! You could feel the excitement buzzing as everyone prepared for the big day.

Our team absolutely nailed the `Innovation Project` presentation. The judges were fully engaged, asking insightful questions, and the girls did a fantastic job presenting their idea: the **Fresh: Hobby Sharing AI App**. It's designed to help people connect over shared interests, and they explained it with such confidence and passion. I could see how impressed the judges were, and it felt like all our hard work in the weeks leading up to this moment really paid off.

When it came to the `Robot Game`, we had an incredible start! In the first round, we scored an impressive **285 points**, which put us in second place right out of the gate. The kids were ecstatic, and the excitement only grew as the day went on. The robot performed consistently well, and our strategies were really coming together. Throughout the day, we maintained a strong performance, and it felt like everything was clicking into place.

By the end of the competition, we had reason to celebrate big time! We were awarded the **Innovation Project Award**, a recognition of the team's creativity and hard work on the Fresh app. On top of that, we finished in **third place in the Robot Game**, a huge accomplishment considering the level of competition we faced.

And the best part? **We're going to the national competition again this year!** It's such an incredible feeling to see all the dedication and teamwork paying off. The kids are thrilled, and so am I. We're already talking about how to take our ideas to the next level as we prepare for nationals.

It's been an amazing day, and we couldn't be more excited for what's next. National competition, here we come! Stay tuned, this journey is far from over!
