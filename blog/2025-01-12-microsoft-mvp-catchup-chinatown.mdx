Catching-up with Tony and Jason (Chuantao), ex-MVPs, over sizzling Korean BBQ ðŸ”¥ðŸ¥© in Chinatown! We talked tech, passion, life, and of course, their legendary MVPSummit moments at Microsoft Redmond campus.

Now, it's time for me to apply leave from family responsibilities. ðŸ¤£ MVP Summit (March 25th to 27th), hope I will be there this year for the first time.
