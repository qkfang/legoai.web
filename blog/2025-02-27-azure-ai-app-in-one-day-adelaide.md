Delivering AI-Apps-in-a-Day workshop in Adelaide was an incredible experiene with my Insight teammate Sadat last Thursday!

We had the privilege of working with a room full of enthusiastic learners in South Australia, all eager to build enterprise AI applications using Microsoft Azure cloud and hashtag#AzureAI services. The energy was electric, a full house of engaged minds ready to turn ideas into reality while prioritizing security and hashtag#ResponsibleAI.

Our sessions covered Azure AI services like hashtag#AIFoundry, OpenAI Service, hashtag#AISearch, and hashtag#ContentSafety, plus Speech, Vision, and Translator. In the hands-on labs, we explored the hashtag#RAG pattern, data ingestion, embedding creation, and vector search. It was amazing to see everyone successfully build chatbots powered by their own hashtag#CosmosDB knowledge base, orchestrated with hashtag#LangChain.

A huge shoutout to Michelle, Simon, Imran, Adam, Tawfique and Ross for organizing and providing this opportunity (especially the swags, all gone!) â€”it was fantastic to see attendees take their hashtag#AI skills to the next level!

Can't wait to see what everyone builds next. If you attended, what was your biggest takeaway from the session?
