We are back at Microsoft Brisbane office again for our second Azure AI App in a Day workshop.

Ready to build the next million-dollar app in just a day? ðŸ’¡ Weâ€™ve just completed our second hashtag#AzureAIAppInADay in Brisbane Microsoft office. Rakesh Lakshminarayana and I had so much fun leading the workshop, and weâ€™re glad to see more participants make it to the end - some of you without even a dev background! Itâ€™s been amazing to keep the momentum going. A big thank you to Tricia Read and Ross Johnson.

In this workshop, we got hands-on with AI app development, hashtag#RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), prompt engineering and built a chatbot using hashtag#CosmosDb for hashtag#MongoDb. With the power of hashtag#Azure and hashtag#OpenAI, we're helping organizations bring their AI ideas to life!

Excited to see what incredible apps come next! Our Insight team is around to help.
