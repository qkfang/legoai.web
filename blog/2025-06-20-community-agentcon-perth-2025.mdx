🏖️ Agentic LEGO Robotics talk at hashtag#AgentCon hashtag#Perth - my day trip to West Coast adventure with over 350 passionate participants! 🤖 What a cracker of a Friday it was! My first-ever talk on the west coast, and you all made it unforgettable. While Sydney shivered at 6°C ❄️, sunny Perth turned it on with huge crowd of amazing people for AI conference. 

I shared the journey📍of building our real-world hashtag#LEGO hashtag#robotics hashtag#agent: a goal-based, multi-agent, functional team of AI agents controlling a LEGO Spike Prime robot. Think of it as LEGO mini-figure engineers who powering the real-world robots.

Here's the agent lineup:
🎮 Controller Agent – Commands the LEGO Spike via hashtag#Bluetooth + hashtag#MCP
👀 Observer Agent – hashtag#YOLO object detection + video streaming (coded by hashtag#GitHub hashtag#Copilot!)
🧭 Planner Agent – Builds action plans using a knowledge base + hashtag#python code library
✅ Judger Agent – Confirms if goals are actually met 
👩‍✈️ Orchestrator Agent – Keeps the whole squad in check
🎤 Voice Agent – Talks to humans like a pro
💻 Interactive UI – Pulls back the curtain so humans can stay in the loop

All this was powered by:
🧠 hashtag#SemanticKernel + hashtag#AzureAIFoundry agent services on Microsoft Azure 
🧱 LEGO Spike Prime 3 from LEGO Education 
🌊 Stories from our robotic team during the FIRST Australia FFL Submerged season

🎙️I also soaked in incredible talks from speakers across hashtag#Australia – so much talent in all 3 tracks from 24 talks in one day! 💡💬
