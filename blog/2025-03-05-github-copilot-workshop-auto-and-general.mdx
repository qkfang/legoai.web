🚀 Wrapped up 2x GitHub Copilot Training day at Auto & General Australia in Brisbane, just before the incoming CycloneAlfred! 🌪️

👥 Engaging over 200+ participants across the organization to explore how GitHubCopilot enhances developer productivity and the coding experience, with an emphasis on SecureCoding and ResponsibleAI.

Together with my Insight teammates, Ahmed & Tay, we covered:
✅ How to draft effective prompts for Copilot
✅ Key features like code completion & Copilot Chat
✅ Best practices for getting the most out of Copilot

Hands-on learning includes:👨‍💻
🔹 Interactive presentations and discussions
🔹 Persona-based labs tailored to different roles
🔹 Practical exercises to seamlessly integrate Copilot into daily development workflows

Looking forward to our 3rd session next week and continuing to supercharge development workflows with GitHub Copilot.

🤞 Fingers crossed for Queensland — stay safe, everyone!
