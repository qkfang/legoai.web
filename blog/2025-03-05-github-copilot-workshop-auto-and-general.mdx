🚀 Wrapped up 2x GitHub Copilot Training day at Auto & General Australia in Brisbane, just before the incoming CycloneAlfred! 🌪️

👥 Engaging over 200+ participants across the organization to explore how GitHubCopilot enhances developer productivity and the coding experience, with an emphasis on SecureCoding and ResponsibleAI.

Together with my Insight teammates, Ahmed & Tay, we covered:
✅ How to draft effective prompts for Copilot
✅ Key features like code completion & Copilot Chat
✅ Best practices for getting the most out of Copilot

Hands-on learning includes:👨‍💻
🔹 Interactive presentations and discussions
🔹 Persona-based labs tailored to different roles
🔹 Practical exercises to seamlessly integrate Copilot into daily development workflows

🙌 A huge thank you to Meret, Wesley, and Ross for putting together such fantastic sessions! Looking forward to our 3rd session next week and continuing to supercharge development workflows with GitHub Copilot.

🤞 Fingers crossed for Queensland — stay safe, everyone!
