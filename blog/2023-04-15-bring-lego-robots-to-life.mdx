There's nothing quite like spending quality time with my two young kids, especially when it involves creativity, learning, and a dash of engineering. Recently, we decided to dive into the world of LEGO robotics at home, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience for all of us.

We started by unpacking our LEGO robotics kit, and the kids' eyes lit up at the sight of all the colorful pieces, motors, and sensors. Together, we followed the instructions to build our very own robot. The process was a fantastic way to teach them about mechanical components and how different parts work together. They eagerly assembled gears, connected motors, and snapped bricks into place, watching as their creation slowly took shape.

Once our robot was built, it was time to bring it to life with code. This was where the real fun, and challenges, began. We opened up the coding software, and I could see the curiosity in their eyes as they looked at the blocks of code. At first, we struggled a bit to understand how the code blocks translated into movements for the robot. The concepts of loops, variables, and commands were new to them, and I had to brush up on my own coding skills as well. We experimented with different code sequences, trying to get the robot to move forward, stop, and even make a turn.

There were moments of frustration when the robot didn't move as expected. The kids would exclaim, "Why isn't it working?" But these challenges turned into valuable learning opportunities. We reviewed our code, identified mistakes, and tried again. It was rewarding to see them develop problem-solving skills and persistence. After some trial and error, we finally figured out how to make the robot move and turn. The joy on their faces when the robot obeyed our commands was priceless. It was like magic seeing their creation come alive and respond to the code they had written.

This experience was more than just playtime; it was an educational journey that introduced my kids to the basics of robotics and programming. They learned that with patience and perseverance, they could overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. We also discovered the importance of teamwork. Each of us brought something to the table, whether it was assembling parts, figuring out the code, or cheering each other on when things got tough.

Building and coding LEGO robots at home has been an incredibly rewarding experience. It's amazing how a box of plastic bricks can open up a world of imagination and education. I highly recommend this activity to any parents looking for a fun and engaging way to spend time with their children.

*Have you tried building robots or coding with your kids? I'd love to hear about your experiences !*
