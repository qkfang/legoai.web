We've been eagerly awaiting the latest release of the **LEGO Spike Prime** apps, and it's finally here! The most exciting part? It now officially supports writing code in **Python**. We can't wait to dive in and start coding like pros. However, our journey hasn't been without its challenges.

The introduction of Python support opens up a whole new world of possibilities for the Spike Prime. Unlike block-based coding, Python allows for more complex and efficient programming, enabling us to tackle advanced projects and fine-tune our robot's performance.

One of the first obstacles we encountered was the scarcity of comprehensive documentation. While the new Python feature is fantastic, the resources available to learn and troubleshoot are somewhat lacking. Some of the official examples even contain errors, which can be frustrating when you're trying to learn.

This is where **ChatGPT** comes into play. By asking ChatGPT for help, we hope to bridge the gap in documentation and get accurate code snippets that work with Spike Prime. We found that ChatGPT can provide explanations of Python concepts, help debug code, and even generate sample programs tailored to our needs.

Controlling the robot involves not just programming but also understanding real-world physics and calculations. For instance, making the robot move a certain distance requires calculations involving wheel circumference and motor rotations. ChatGPT has been instrumental in helping us understand these concepts by breaking down the calculations and explaining the physics behind them.

While there's still a learning curve, combining the new Python capabilities of Spike Prime with the support of ChatGPT has made the process much more manageable.
